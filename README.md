README
================

The set of files in this repo is submitted as the Course Project of the '*Getting and Cleaning Data*' course.

<u>Available files</u>:

* README.md -- this file
* run_analysis.R -- R function carrying out the data cleaning process including (but not limited to): loading original data from R workspace, merging original raw data from several source files, cleaning data, renaming and selecting variables, saving complete tidy dataset, computing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, saving them in a new data file 
* TidyData.txt -- the tidy data set comprising all the observations for all the relevant variables
* CodeBook.md -- this file gathers in one single place all the relevant information for this course project. CodeBook.md provides detailed information on:
	1. Origin of data
	2. Experimental design
	3. Description of the data in the tidy data set
	4. Naming
	5. Description of the variables
	6. Description of transformation from original data sets. Comments to code
		1. STEP 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
		2. STEP 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
		3. STEP 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set .
		4. STEP 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
		5. STEP 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
